<li> Stochastic oscillators measure recent prices on a scale of 0 to 100, with measurements above 80 indicating that an asset is overbought and measurements below 20 indicating that it is oversold.</li>
<li>
  Stochastic oscillator charting generally consists of two lines: one reflecting the actual value of the oscillator (%K) for each session and one reflecting its three-day simple moving average(%D).
</li>
<li>the intersection of these two lines is considered to be a signal that a reversal may be in the works, as it indicates a large shift in momentum from day to day.</li>
<li>Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and trending price action is also seen as an important reversal signal.</li>
